# R-ProductNamesChecker
Short R script for counting how many times an image (it's filename) appears in a .csv file with stock products

This was made for one my teams website projects. We needed to find out which of the products in stocklist were represented in a folder with subfolders by product code.

R + Stringr packadge were very helpful.
